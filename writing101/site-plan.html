      <p>Know your with words? Not to worry, this website is not merely for new writers excited to start on their new journey. With videos diving into your favorite novels, to uncover what makes them successful? what makes them unsuccessful? What caused a certain sequel to outshine it's predecessor.

      <p>Imagine you are unfortunately in a bout of writer's block. You're not sure what's wrong with a scene your writing. You're not sure what to do, so you try opening up this website. There you are met with a choice between diving into two libraries of videos, one dedicated to World building, the other for standard writing advice. You go to the one for World Building, cause you quite aren't sure how to make a certain town feel more realistic. Opening this up you are meant with a collection of videos, and quickly scanning them you find a section about different biomes and how to scientifically recreate them yourself, like what elements are required for making a swamp setting. You try some of these videos and quickly find why your snowy village wasn't feeling realistic! You then head to the section with your Standard Writing Advice, you've been having trouble recently getting your characters to sound realistic when they talk. You quicly scour the library and find a video labeled something about character dialogue. Upon watching the video you learn or perhaps you remember all the little details it takes to make a conversation flow realistically. Perhaps you overexaggerate character's emotions? Perhaps you're interupting your characters too much when they're speaking to interject unnecessary description. You watch the whole video through and go back to writing to implement the new things you've learned, and VIOLA!</p>
      <p>This Website is made for writers, by a writer, with advice that extends over such a wide variety of topics and problems. Even if you don't find an answer to your specific problem you are sure to find useful advice here. Advice that will change your novel from good to great. So buckle up and prepare yourself for an assault of beautiful writing advice, worldbuilding help, and deep dives into your favorite stories.</p>

      <p>         
        wireframes 2 and 3 are identical, the difference will be seen when the actual websites are made and the content is different. But for now i think keeping the same general structure for both works since they both are used for the same thing just different information that will be given.
