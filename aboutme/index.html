    <p> 
        Hello! I'm Joshua Dean, I'm 19 years old and live in Kansas. I love coding and the problem solving that comes with it!
        Nothing really beats the feeling of when you finally figure out a nifty solution to a problem you've been working on in programming!
        I haven't felt anything like it.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm super into anything creative!
        I love Drawing, Writing, Creating Games, Music. I'm just a total geek for artsy stuff! And although I'm kind of lackluster in all of those currently,
        I'm currently taking the time to continuously grow and develop my skills in these fields, because they all greatly interest me!
    </p>
    <p>
        Anywho, that's all from me. I'll be seeing you all around!!
    </p>
